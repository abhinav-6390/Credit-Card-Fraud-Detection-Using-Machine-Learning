# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Classification of fraudulent credit card transactions. 

I investigate different machine learning models in this notebook to identify credit card fraud. I contrast the output and performance of every model. The SMOTE approach yields the best performance.

Please be aware that various detection analyses in alternative domains can be performed using the same methodology. The procedure for extracting features is still the same and can be repeated for numerous additional detection problems.
